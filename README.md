## getting started
Add ormx and sqlx to your `Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies.ormx]
version = "0.11"
features = ["postgres"]

[dependencies.sqlx]
version = "0.8"
features = ["postgres", "runtime-tokio-rustls"]
```

## what does it do? 
ormx provides macros for generating commonly used sql queries at compile time.  
ormx is meant to be used together with sqlx. Everything it generates uses `sqlx::query!` under the hood, so every generated query will be checked against your database at compile time.

## what doesn't it do?
ormx is not a full-fledged ORM nor a query builder. For everything except simple CRUD, you can always just use sqlx.  

it is required that every table contains an id column, which uniquely
identifies a row. probably, you would want to use an auto-incrementing integer for this.
this is a central requirement of ormx, and if your table does not fulfill this requirement, ormx
is not what you are looking for.

## databases

| database   | cargo feature             |
|------------|---------------------------|
| PostgreSQL | postgres[^1]              |
| MariaDB    | mariadb                   |
| MySQL      | mysql[^2]                 |
| SQLite     | *currently not supported* |

[^1]: out of these three, the `postgres` backend is the most mature.   
[^2]: the `mysql` backend *does* work with both MariaDB and MySQL, though the `mariadb` backend emits cleaner and probably faster queries.


## [example](https://github.com/NyxCode/ormx/tree/master/example-postgres/src/main.rs)
first, start a postgres database.  
if you have docker installed, you can do so using `./scripts/postgres.sh`.  
next, set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable: `export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:admin@localhost/ormx`.  
now, inside `example-postgres`, use the sqlx cli to setup the database schema: `cargo sqlx db setup`.  
finally, run `cargo run`.

## help
if you encounter an issue or have questions, feel free to ask in [`#ormx` on the sqlx discord](https://discord.gg/mrZz4Wv8r2).  
The documentation currently is not what it should be, so don't be afraid to ask for help.

## migrate
### to 0.11
v0.11 updated the sqlx dependency to v0.8.  
most notably, the semantics of the `sqlx::Executor` trait have somewhat changed. in most cases, this is fixed by adding a `*` here or there.

### to 0.7
Since 0.7, id columns are not special anymore - if they are generated by the database, you must annotate them with `#[ormx(default)]`.

## a note on reborrowing
if you run into the issue that the compiler tells you that you can't re-use a `&mut Connection` because  
- `use of moved value` and
- `move occurs because 'con' has type '&mut Connection', which does not implement the 'Copy' trait`  

you'll have to manually reborrow the connection with `&mut *con`.
